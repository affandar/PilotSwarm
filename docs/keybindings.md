Notes:

- The prompt grows to a three-line viewport and then scrolls as you keep adding lines.
- Attached files are uploaded immediately and inserted into the outgoing prompt as `artifact://...` references when the message is sent.
- Every send first lands in a per-session local outbox, then transitions through three durability states shown next to each user message in chat:
  - `○` pending — client-only, not yet acknowledged by the runtime
  - `✓` queued — durably enqueued to the orchestration, waiting to be processed
  - `✓✓` sent — persisted as a `user.message` in the durable transcript; the LLM has it
- Multiple synchronous sends coalesce into a single durable enqueue. Pressing `Enter` on an empty draft forces an immediate dispatch of any still-pending items.
- Pressing `↑` at the top prompt boundary recalls the most recent pending item for editing. Pressing `↓` at the bottom boundary moves forward through pending items and eventually returns to the live draft.
- `Esc` while editing a recalled pending item cancels that item before it becomes durable.
